# Project 2: Algorithmic Trading Technical Pattern Identification using Python - Inverse Head and Shoulders

## What is the Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern?

The **Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S)** pattern is a visual chart formation used in technical analysis to identify potential trend reversals from bearish to bullish. It is composed of three main troughs and a neckline:

- **Left Shoulder (LS)** ‚Äì The first dip in the price, followed by a small upward correction.
- **Head (H)** ‚Äì The lowest trough, forming the center of the pattern.
- **Right Shoulder (RS)** ‚Äì A second dip that is higher than the head but similar in depth to the left shoulder.
- **Neckline** ‚Äì A line connecting the highest points between the two shoulders.
- **Break Point** ‚Äì The level at which the price breaks above the neckline, confirming the reversal pattern.
- **Start and End Points** ‚Äì Define where the pattern begins forming and where it is confirmed by the breakout.

This pattern visually resembles an upside-down human head with two shoulders, which is where it gets its name.

## Historical Performance and Ideal Usage

**Success Rate:** ~65‚Äì75% on daily charts of S&P 500 stocks

**When It Works Best:**

1. Appears after an **extended downtrend**, signaling a potential bullish reversal.
2. **Breakout occurs with high trading volume**, confirming buying interest.
3. The **pattern is clear and symmetrical** for better reliability.

**Timeframes:**  
- More reliable on **daily and weekly charts**  
- Less effective on very short intraday timeframes

**Market Type:**  
- Works best in **liquid markets** like the S&P 500 or large-cap stocks

**Confirmation Tools:**  
- Often combined with indicators like **RSI**, **MACD**, or **Volume spikes** to increase the confidence of the signal.

## Understanding the project

This project provides a Python implementation to **detect and analyze
Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) patterns**---a classic technical analysis
formation used in trading and investing. It supports **inverted** (bullish) patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

-   **Automatic detection** of:
    -   Left Shoulder
    -   Head
    -   Right Shoulder
    -   Neckline and breakout points
-   **Pattern metrics calculation**, including:
    -   Neckline slope
    -   Head width & height
-   **Visualization** using `mplfinance` for candlestick charts
-   **Integration with Yahoo Finance** for real market data
-   **Support for inverted (bullish) H&S patterns**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Structure

    head-and-shoulders.py   # Main script for pattern detection and visualization
    rolling_window.py       # Utility for rolling top/bottom detection (imported)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Python Modules Used

This project uses a combination of Python modules for data processing, technical analysis, and visualization:

**pandas** ‚Äì Efficiently handles stock price data as DataFrames.

**numpy** ‚Äì Used for numerical computations like slopes and distances.

**matplotlib** ‚Äì Creates general line and pattern plots.

**mplfinance** ‚Äì Generates professional candlestick and OHLC charts.

**yfinance** ‚Äì Fetches historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required Python libraries:

``` bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib mplfinance yfinance
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage

1.  **Import and Run the Script**

``` python
import head_and_shoulders as hs

# Example: Fetch and analyze Apple (AAPL) stock
import yfinance as yf

data = yf.download("AAPL", period="1y", interval="1d")
patterns = hs.detect_head_and_shoulders(data['Close'])
```

2.  **Visualize Detected Patterns**

``` python
hs.plot_patterns(data, patterns)
```

This will display candlestick charts with detected **Head and
Shoulders** formations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example Output

-   **Annotated candlestick charts** highlighting the left shoulder,
    head, right shoulder, and neckline.
-   **Pattern statistics** including head height, neckline slope, and
    breakout point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How It Works

1.  **Rolling Window Detection**
    -   Uses `rw_top` and `rw_bottom` from `rolling_window.py` to find
        local peaks and troughs.
2.  **Pattern Recognition**
    -   Identifies sequences of left shoulder ‚Üí head ‚Üí right shoulder
        with a neckline.
3.  **Visualization**
    -   Plots candlestick charts with overlayed patterns using
        `mplfinance`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Applications

-   Technical analysis for **trading strategies**
-   Identifying potential **trend reversals**
-   Backtesting **pattern-based trading algorithms**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

-   This project is for **educational purposes** and does **not
    constitute financial advice**.
-   Accuracy depends on **data quality** and **parameter tuning**.
-   Works for **daily and intraday** intervals.
